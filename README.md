# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
- I built an application that generates a randomized mantra or affirmation. When the application loads the user is offered one of two options, one being an affirmation and the other being a mantra. This Javascript application uses query selectors, event listeners, and a method to randomize the arrays index to push an affirmation or mantra that is displayed on the lower hallf of the application. 

### Installation Instructions:
The instructions were to 
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository to my local machine.
3. Follow the instructions on the Turing link for the Self Care Center project.

### Context:
- I struggled on creating the HTML and connecting it to js. I googled and watched a lot of helpful Scrimba videos all Thursday and Friday evening. Once I got a skeleton of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I reached out to my rock to help steer me in the right direction. A fresh pair of eyes is what I needed to solidify the code I had. I worked on this project an average of 5 hours a night during the week and all day over the weekend. I am currently going into week four of Turing, and I'm hopeful to end this module soon with confidence in my current level of knowledge for module two.

### Contributors:
-This was a solo project.

### Learning Goals:
- This project was very similar to our last project yet it was elevated because we had to create our own HTML and CSS. It was nice to work on this project solo so that I was aware of my weaknesses since I did not have a partner to rely on. I realized that I need to practice on syntax for functions. It's one thing to hear the information during a zoom call but, personally for me, I find myself absorbing and solidifying more during a one on one conversation. Although I did not complete the project fully, I now understand the key to me succeeding and completing Turing ready for the workforce is to sign up for student support and reach out to my cohort and rocks. This solo project was a real eye opener for me to strengthen my weaknesses in coding to become a better coder.  

### Wins + Challenges:
1. I struggled for multiple days trying to figure out how to add the radio buttons and the 'receive message' button to appear on the same container. I tried what felt like everything to have them inside the same container while displaying the radio buttons above the 'receive message' button. Today, Sunday, I figured out that I didn't have a class name for each type of button. Once I figured that out I was able to refactor my HTML code and set the flex direction to row.
2. A win was applying the Scrimba lesson on flexbox. I definately will utilize those video lessons again.
